- Hi, I’m @abigaelbousquet
- I’m interested in computer science, software engineering, and computer engineering.
- I’m currently studying CS and Computer Engineering at Brown University. Class of 2026 :)
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve data processing and user-centered design.

Big Java fan, but Python is okay too I suppose. Hot/warm take: Javadocs are the most beautiful thing to ever exist.

PS. enjoy my profile picture of the shirt I wear whenever I temporarily question my career choices (usually because of a typo).

- 👋 Hi, I’m @abigaelbousquet
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, software engineering, and computer engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying CS and engineering at Brown University. Class of 2026 :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve processing data and user-centered design.

I have a year of experience with Java and a year of experience with Python. I'm learning Racket now! I'm a big fan of Java, although most of my projects in Java use starter code that I didn't write, so I can't post them publically. I'm happy to share access to additional Java projects/repositories upon request though!
